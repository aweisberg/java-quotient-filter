# JavaQuotientFilter
A Java Quotient Filter implementation based on https://github.com/vedantk/quotient-filter

Nothing in this is final yet in terms of API or implementation. It is a solid base to start with if you need a Java quotient filter in a hurry.

Force push on master is still a thing for now.
